# Specification Quality Checklist: Backup and Restore

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 16 items pass validation
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- This feature extends the `platform-cli` (feature 045) which already defined the backup/restore command structure and per-store backup tooling decisions
- Selective backup creation (backing up only specific stores) is explicitly out of scope — full backup only; partial restore is supported
- Kafka backup is limited to consumer group offsets (topic data is ephemeral by design)
